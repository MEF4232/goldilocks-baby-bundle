# baby-share

project outline

- 3 or 6 month subscriptions
- pick out clothes (type, child's age or size, seasonal, etc.)
- get credit towards next subscriptions if you donate things you already own
- start with clothes (onesie, shirt, pants, dress, shoes, etc.) and add toys, carriers, costumes, etc. later on
- priced by bundle for clothes, not individual items. other items may have one-time option


purpose

- reduce, reuse, recycle
- "it takes a village to raise a child"
- making the lives of new parent's a bit easier: no need to frequently buy new clothes, shipped directly to home, minimize "trash bags of baby clothes in the basement"
