# goldilocks-baby-bundle

project outline

- 3 or 6 month subscriptions
- pick out clothes (e.g. type, child's age or size, seasonal, etc.)
- get credit towards next subscriptions if you donate things you already own
- start with clothes (e.g. onesie, shirt, pants, dress, jacket, shoes, hat, etc.) and add toys, carriers, costumes, etc. later on
- priced by bundle for clothes, not individual items. other items may have one-time option (e.g. Halloween) or return in 30 days without charge (e.g. baby carrier)
- potentially different shopping carts for different children, depends on subscription cycle


purpose

- reduce, reuse, recycle
- "it takes a village to raise a child"
- making the lives of new parent's a bit easier: no need to frequently buy new clothes during growth spurts, shipped directly to home, minimize "trash bags of baby clothes in the basement"

- new parents and/or parents of children under 5 years old
